# c-ATM-version-1
This ATM simulator is coded in c++. It is a version 1 for now, and features a polished and fully functional menu, that has 2 options: 1/Withdraw money 2/ Deposit money. The ATM remembers the account balance after the user has relaunched the simulator. In the future I plan to add more options such as "change your PIN nr" and add new accounts. As always I welcome every contribution very happily!
Enjoy!
